# Data Analysis using Python-Pandas dataframe
People with OCD experience concomitant sleep issues, which are usually not clinically identified and diagnosed. Sleep deprivation has a negative impact on people’s health and cognitive functioning. This research investigates the opportunity to support OCD patients suffering from sleep disturbances with a CBT app to prompt good OCD and sleep hygiene behaviours.   Yardley’s PBA design is pragmatized in refining the design process and test acceptability. Prototype is created based on the features derived from literature that support best behaviour theory practises. The quantitative study was conducted where participants were asked to fill the OCD-Sleep questionnaire. The qualitative study was conducted with 2 iterative interviews discussing the prototype.  The majority of the basic hypothesis was validated by users, with some further work necessary in areas crucial to behaviour modification. The quantitative analysis provided insights on the positive correlation between the OCD and sleep parameters. The prototype building was initiated by developing the OCD-Sleep MOT questionnaire and developing data visualization in Python-Jupyter notebook.
